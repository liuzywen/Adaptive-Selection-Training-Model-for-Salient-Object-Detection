# Adaptive-Selection-Training-Model-for-Salient-Object-Detection  

# Abstract  

Salient object detection has achieved the significant performance on benchmark datasets recently. However most of the existing salient object detection models assume that at least one salient object exists in the input image. When there is no salient object in the scene, these models can not achieve the satisfied results owing to lack of the training data of non-salient images.  Although the model can be retrained, adding non-salient images weakens the ability of the model to detect salient objects. Therefore an adaptive selection training model  is proposed. It can automatically select salient images by using saliency existence prediction ground truth labels to augment the training, when achieving salient object detection by jointly training salient object detection task and saliency existence prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can improve the accuracy of salient object detection by being aware of existence of salient objects and reduce false positive detections on non-salient images.
